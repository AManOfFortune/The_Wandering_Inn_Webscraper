3. Open the "index.js" file and replace the first line in the file with "const hostingAddress = "http://localhost:80".
4. Open the "script.js" file in the "Client" directory and do the same.
5. After all the previous steps have been completed, you should be able to run "npm run start" in your terminal. This should start the server, which should print "Listening on Port 80" in the console.
6. If the server is running successfully, you can open a browser of your choice and type "localhost" in your searchbar, which opens the app.
